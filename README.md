## What is churn analysis?

  Churn analysis is the evaluation of a company’s customer loss rate in order to reduce it. Also referred to as customer attrition rate, churn can be minimized by assessing your product and how people use it.

## Why you should analyze your churn frequently and accurately

  Churn is a hugely influential statistic across a SaaS business. It’s the metric by which businesses, young and old, live or die. Letting your churn rate creep higher can lead to a number of related problems.


## The Difficulty of Predicting Churn

  Churn prediction modeling techniques attempt to understand the precise customer behaviors and attributes which signal the risk and timing of customer churn. The accuracy of the technique used is obviously critical to the success of any proactive retention efforts. After all, if the marketer is unaware of a customer about to churn, no action will be taken for that customer. Additionally, special retention-focused offers or incentives may be inadvertently provided to happy, active customers, resulting in reduced revenues for no good reason.
